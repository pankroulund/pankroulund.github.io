I wanted to do everything from the bottom and not just buy a flight computer and a prebuilt frame. My background is, that I am a mechanical engineering student, and I have access to a program called Simulink, which I want to use to make a \r\nmathematical model of the Quadcopter, which will enable me to use control system analysis tools on it.\r\nYou can find my Quadcopter page at this link\r\n[Quadcopter with Arduino mega](http://www.roulund.eu/Quadcopter_Arduino_mega/)  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
